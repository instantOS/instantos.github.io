# Roadmap

A more technical and live updating list of concrete features can be found [here](https://github.com/instantOS/instantOS/projects/1)

## Finish up Documentation

Most articles from the Arch Wiki should apply to instantOS, so the documentation
will focus in instantOS specific things only.
It will consist of many short articles with a video and text version that teach
a single feature at a time. Learn the basics and add one more feature a day to
your workflow to build your muscle memory and you'll be taking full advantage of
all features in no time.
