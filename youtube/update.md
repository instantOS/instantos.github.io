# Updating instantOS

To update instantOS, open a terminal and run yay.
It will prompt you for your root password and to confirm installing the updates.
This tool will update all programs from the official repositories and the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org)

Just like with any other Linux distro, you can continue using your computer while installing updates.
Updates to some instantOS components will however require a restart to become visible.
