appear in a bubble at the top left of the screen, stay there for a while
and then automatically disappear. They can also be closed by right clicking
on them.
Application defined context actions like confirmation prompts or just
shortcuts to where the notification comes from are available by left
clicking on the bubble.

## Deleting notifications

Notifications can either be deleted individually by selecting them and
choosing the delete option or by pressing shift + left/right arrow key in
the notification center where you can delete notifications that contain a
certain keyword, come from a specific application or you van just clear all
