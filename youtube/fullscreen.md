# Fakefullscreen

Fakefullscreen allows you to resize and move fullscreen windows. The application will still think it is in full screen. 
This can be used to move applications that would otherwise be stuck on the monitor they launched on or to correct applications that behave incorrectly. 

To toggle fakefullscreen, press Super + Shift + F
If the application is not in fullscreen, this will not have any noticeable effect. 
But as soon as the application goes into fullscreen, it will not cover the entire screen, but can still be put into layouts, moved around in floating mode or even resized.
Some applications will not like being resized while in full screen mode, so be careful with that. 
Fakefullscreen can also be activated for applications that are already in fullscreen mode. 
Pressing Super + Shift + F a second time will deactivate fakefullscreen.
