Opening applications can be done in several ways. 
The most beginner friendly one is probably the graphical launcher. 
It is accessed by clicking on the desktop or status bar, pressing space on an
empty tag or with Super + y.
You can search through applications and press return or click on them to
launch them. More frequently used applications will be put first.

There is also a text based launcher. It is accessed with Super + Space or
right clicking on the desktop. It will show all applications in $PATH, not
just those having a desktop menu entry.
