If you are coming from Windows or another desktop environment, you are likely
familiar with alt-tab menus. To use it, hold down Alt and press Tab multiple
times to toggle through a list of all open applications. Letting go of Alt,
pressing Enter or click on an entry will switch to the application. You can also
press Tab just a single time and proceed to type in the application name. There
is also a more visual version available. It can be accessed using ++super+"^"++
(the caret key) or by right clicking on the status bar in the top right.
