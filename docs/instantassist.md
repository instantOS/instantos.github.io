instantOS comes with instantASSIST, a collection of small little programs that
can be accessed using only a few keystrokes.

Access it using ++super+a++. This will pop up a menu showing all available
keystrokes.
Hovering over a letter will display a short description.
Press one of them to activate the corresponding section. Some
assists will have multiple options available. They will be displayed in the
same menu. Press the key again to go with the default one, press one of the
keys listed to execute their corresponding action.  These key combinations are
called assists.  

For example: The w-assist consists of pressing ++super+a++ to activate the menu
and then typing in ++w++.  The w-assist is responsible for quickly changing your
wallpaper. It will list some other options. Press w again to execute the
default action which is generating a new wallpaper from a random source.

The h-assist will list all available assists and their purposes.
