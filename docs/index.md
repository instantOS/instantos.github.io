# Welcome to instantOS

You can learn how to use instantOS by adding one feature at a time to your
workflow. Each feature lists what you need to know to understand it and links
to documentation pages where you can learn those things.

Each feature has a short video explaining it or a text based description below
it if you prefer that.
