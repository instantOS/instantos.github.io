instantOS is an Arch based distro that works out of the box but is still aimed
at power users.  
Everything is lightning fast, flexible and just works.

## Overview

### Just works

The user does not have to worry about everything from wifi to volume and
brightness, theming and notification-management. A graphical settings menu
ensures accessibility for anyone just like with a desktop environment.

### Power-user friendly

instantOS has lots of functionality that goes beyond that of a normal desktop
environment like tiling and instantASSIST that ensure a high skill ceiling

### Ultra lightweight

The RAM usage on idle is about 150-160Mb (tested on a fresh install on
Virtualbox). That is less than half of what the lightest Ubuntu flavor uses. It
comes with as little bloat as possible without sacrificing on features.

### Feature rich

The small footprint is **not** achieved through measures like slimming down the
kernel or compromising on features and visuals.

### Hybrid window manager

instantWM can do both tiling and floating windows with none of them being a
second class citizen. It maintains full feature parity with dwm when it comes
to tiling and the floating features can rival most conventional desktop environments.

### Keyboard and Mouse/touch support

A keyboard centered workflow can make you much more productive but getting rid
of the mouse is not the best thing for everyone. Tiling WMs actually make a lot
of sense for tablets since screen estate is important and if you are using a
graphics tablet it may be important as well to have a way of doing things with
the mouse. That's why the interface can be fully navigated using only the mouse.
