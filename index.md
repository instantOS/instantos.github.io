features:
  - title: Just works
    details: The user does not have to worry about everything from wifi to volume and brightness, theming and notification-management. A graphical settings menu ensures accessibility for anyone just like with a desktop environment.
  - title: Power-user friendly
    details: instantOS has lots of functionality that goes beyond that of a normal desktop environment like tiling and instantASSIST that ensure a high skill ceiling.
  - title: Ultra lightweight
    details: The RAM usage on idle is about 150-160Mb (tested on a fresh install on Virtualbox). That is less than half of what the lightest Ubuntu flavor uses.
  - title: Feature rich
    details: The small footprint is not achieved through measures like slimming down the kernel or compromising on features and visuals.
  - title: Hybrid window manager
    details: instantWM can do both tiling and floating windows with none of them being a second class citizen.
  - title: Keyboard and Mouse support
    details: A keyboard centered workflow can make you much more productive but getting rid of the mouse is not the best thing for everyone.

**instantOS** is an Arch Linux based distro that works out of the box but is still aimed at power users. Everything is lightning fast, flexible and just works.

In addition to the usual [Arch packages](https://github.com/instantOS/extra), we also package for the [Nix](https://nixos.org/explore.html) universal package manager (and [NixOS](https://nixos.org)) via **[instantNIX](https://github.com/instantOS/instantNIX/)**.
